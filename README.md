<h1>Machine Learning from First Principle</h1>
<p>A repository to derive all machine learning and deep learning algorithms from first principle.</p>
<p>While there are a myriad of libraries available today, I want to make sure that I understand all of the algorithms fully so that my solutions are robust to changes.</p>
<p>All of the algorithm derivations will be done in Python using Jupyter Notebook.</p>

<h1>To Do</h1>
<li>K-Means</li>
<li>Naive Bayes</li>
<li>Perceptron</li>
<li>Multi-layer Perceptron</li>
<li>Support Vector Machine</li>
<li>Random Forest</li>
