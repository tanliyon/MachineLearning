<h1>Linear Regression</h1>
<p>Linear regression is a basic algorithm used for prediction when the outcome is continous. The logistic regression on the otherhand handles discrete outcomes.</p>
<p>The algorithm basically finding the 'best-fit' line of the datapoints by minimizing the average RMS error from each point, and from that best-fit line we will be able to generalize the outcome when given a set of inputs.</p>
<p>Many variations exist for linear regression, mainly focusing on ways to adjust the regularization term added to the cost function to prevent overfitting</p>

<h2>Variations to Implement</h2>
<li>LASSO</li>
<li>Elastic Net</li>
<li>Ridge Regression</li>
<li>Direct solution by solving the derivative</li>
